# cockpit-gluster
A [cockpit](https://github.com/cockpit-project/cockpit) plugin that provides a status view and volume actions for a gluster cluster with [glusterd2](https://github.com/gluster/glusterd2)(GD2) based bricks.

It runs on any of the brick nodes (where glusterd2 is running).

## Building from source

### Install Build Dependencies

```
sudo yum install -y npm
npm install
```

### Build the project
```
./node_modules/.bin/webpack
```

### Developing with vagrant:
After building run these commands in the repo folder:
```
#install vagrant
sudo yum install vagrant -y
sudo vagrant up

```
and browse to `localhost:9091`. Congratulations, you're up!

After making any changes to the code you can run `npx webpack && sudo vagrant rsync` to build and copy the plugin to the VMs.
Refresh the browser to see your changes.


## Make an rpm
```
make rpm
```


## Setup your brick servers with GD2


As GD2 is in development, it is recommended to build it from the `master` branch and deploy it with an external etcd.
See [GD2 Resources](#gd2-resources) for more information, and automated setup.

## Installing (on one of the GD2 nodes)
### Install gluster-ansible and its dependencies:

gluster-ansible is hosted in a [copr repo](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/sac/gluster-ansible/)

#### Install the repo:

| Operating System            | Install Command |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| Centos 7      | `sudo curl -o /etc/yum.repos.d/gluster-ansible.repo https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/sac/gluster-ansible/repo/epel-7/sac-gluster-ansible-epel-7.repo`        |
| Fedora 27+     | `sudo dnf copr enable sac/gluster-ansible`  |


#### Install the packages from the repo:

```
sudo yum install gluster-ansible python-gluster-mgmt-client

```

## Install cockpit-gluster
```
yum install -y cockpit-gluster-x.x.x-x.noarch.rpm
```
## Browse to the cockpit port:
`http://your-cockpithost.domain:9090`



## Creating volumes

Setup passwordless ssh from the managing host (where cockpit-gluster is installed) to all the other nodes:

Run these commands on the managing host:
```
ssh-keygen

ssh-copy-id root@host1.example.com
ssh-copy-id root@host2.example.com
ssh-copy-id root@host3.example.com
```

Click on:
 - Create Volume (if creating on the existing cluster)
 - Expand Cluster (if creating on new nodes)
